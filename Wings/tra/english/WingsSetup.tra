@22   = ~Steel Feathers~
@23   = ~This elven chainmail was commissioned by a bladesinger who personally oversaw every aspect of its creation, testing each new facet to ensure it met her very precise requirements and high standards. It was to be worn into battle against an oncoming orc horde, and when the time came her fastidiousness was rewarded. While battles are not won by individual warriors, many orcs fell to her sword, and the mail's light weight and other enhancements enabled her to better support her allies on the field. There are some who say that long after her death, a piece of the bladesinger's soul lingers on in the armor, imparting a fraction of her own skill and experience to the wearer.
